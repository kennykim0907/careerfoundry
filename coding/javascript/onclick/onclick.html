      Truth and love are frequently discussed in our world but seldom practiced.
      From politicians to marketers, people conveniently ignore or conceal facts
      and use words to enhance positions or sell products. Perjury is common,
      and integrity and credibility are endangered species. Words, twisted in
      meaning and torn from context, have become mere tools for ego building. It
      is not surprising that we have to “swear” to tell the truth.
